# Tvde1 - Selfbot

This is my selfbot. This was the 3rd time I started one again.
I rewrote the whole thing some weeks ago and it's all ES6 modules now.

If you read this, that means I've made it public now, have fun stealing.  
I've added the Apache 2.0 License so that means **give me credit when you steal code**. (A simple `//Tvde1 made this.` will do.)

Also, my image-manipulation commands work via my api. Some day I'll document it.  
I'm not sure if it will be publicly available and free for everyone.
