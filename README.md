# Tvde1 - Selfbot

I've finally released my selfbot to everyone.
This was the 3rd restart of creating a selfbot and I'm finally satisfied.
I also rewrote the whole thing some weeks ago and it's all ES6 modules now.

If you read this, that means I've made it public now, so have fun stealing.  
I've added the Apache 2.0 License so that means **give me credit when you steal code**. (A simple `//Tvde1 made this.` will do.)

Also, my image-manipulation commands work via my api. I've documented it [here](https://github.com/Tvde1/tvde1-api-documentation/blob/master/README.md). Steal my api connector code if you want.

I will accept PRs and merge them if you can contribute (bug fixes or perhaps additions). No "delet this" PRs though please.

###### P.S.

Selfbots are against the TOS so don't use 'em. This is just a proof of concept thingy I swear.
